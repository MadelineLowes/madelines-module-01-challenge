<!-- - semantic elements can define the intended structure of a web page
    <nav>This defines a group of elements that help users navigate away from the current page to a different page, such as a list of social media links</nav>
    <section>This defines a group of content with a single theme, such as a contact info page</section>    
- adding structure to code in turn adds structure to your webpage and makes both more readable --> -->

<!-- - sometimes we aren't able to use the more meaningful HTML tags like <button> or <li> and are working with code that uses generic elements like <div>
    - in these cases and only if we can't use semantic tags, we can improve accessibility with the roll="" attributes
    - <div role="alert">This warns users about events or changes in content; this is usually more urgent</div> -->
